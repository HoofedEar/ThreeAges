### What works so far
- [x] Moving the player around a scene (WASD)
- [x] Solid objects that handle collisions, player can't walk through them
- [x] If the player is behind a large object that obstructs the player, the object will kindly make itself slightly transparent 
- [x] Clicking on objects checks if the player is close enough to them to interact with
- [ ] The rest of the owl
